# Contributing to BetterWispr

Thanks for helping out. Bug reports, fixes and focused features are all welcome.

## Setup

You need macOS 14+, a Swift 6.2+ toolchain and Xcode or the Command Line Tools.
The first build downloads Swift package dependencies, so it needs internet.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/opennookorg/betterwispr.git
cd betterwispr
make dev
```

`make dev` builds, runs every check and launches `.build/debug/BetterWispr.app`.
Always launch through `make run` or `./scripts/run.sh` so macOS attaches
microphone and Accessibility permissions to the app bundle.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `make run` | Build and launch the debug app |
| `make test` | `swift test` plus the evaluator checks |
| `make lint` | Show compiler warnings |
| `make offline-test MODEL=parakeet-v3` | Transcribe with networking denied |
| `make help` | List every target |

`scripts/build-app.sh` signs with your first code-signing identity, or
`CODESIGN_IDENTITY` if set. With ad-hoc signing, macOS revokes Accessibility on
every rebuild, so paste falls back to copy.

Test a model without the UI:

```sh
swift run BetterWisprCLI --list-models
swift run BetterWisprCLI --download-model parakeet-v3
swift run BetterWisprCLI --transcribe-file audio.wav --model parakeet-v3 --language en
```

Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) before adding a model,
provider or integration.

## Ground rules

- **Local by default.** Built-in transcription stays on device. API providers are
  opt-in only and are never used as a fallback. Models download only after an
  explicit user action. API keys go in the Keychain.
- **Don't break safety checks.** Keep the permission checks, app-focus and
  clipboard safeguards, cancellation and audio cleanup. Never paste a stale result.
- **Concurrency.** UI state stays on the main actor. Don't block audio callbacks
  or silence Swift concurrency diagnostics without a documented reason.
- **Data.** Keep raw and corrected transcripts separate. Schema changes to saved
  data need a migration.
- **No invented numbers.** Don't claim accuracy or benchmark results you haven't measured.
- **Never commit** models, recordings, transcripts, keys or signing assets.
- **Third-party code** keeps its license and is recorded in [docs/oss-reuse.md](docs/oss-reuse.md).

## Pull requests

1. Branch from `main` and keep the change focused.
2. Run `make test` and `make lint`.
3. For permission, shortcut, paste or offline behavior, follow the manual
   checklist in [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) and say in the PR what you
   tested by hand versus what only passed automated checks.
4. Add an entry to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for
   user-visible changes.
5. Use conventional commit prefixes, e.g. `feat(core):`, `fix(app):`, `chore(web):`.

## Releases (maintainers)

`make ship` builds, signs with Developer ID, notarizes and staples
`release/BetterWispr-<version>_arm64.dmg`, signs it for Sparkle and writes
`release/appcast.xml`. Publish both on a GitHub release tagged `v<version>`
using the `gh release create` command the script prints.
